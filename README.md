# SNHU-CS-305

Artemis Financial, a financial consulting firm, needed to modernize its software while ensuring strong security measures to protect sensitive client data. Their key requirement was to enhance secure communication through encryption, HTTPS security, and checksum verification for data integrity. To achieve this, I implemented TLS/SSL encryption with HTTPS, added SHA-256 checksum verification, and conducted a vulnerability assessment using OWASP Dependency Check to identify and mitigate risks. One challenge was distinguishing false positives from real vulnerabilities, but thorough research helped me understand how third-party libraries affect security. Secure coding is crucial because data breaches can lead to financial loss, reputational damage, and legal consequences, making strong security essential for maintaining trust and compliance.

To ensure security and functionality, I tested the application at each step, verified secure endpoints, and ran a secondary dependency check to confirm no new vulnerabilities were introduced. I used Java Keytool for SSL certificates, Spring Boot security features, and OWASP tools for vulnerability scanning. These practices increased layers of protection and ensured secure data transmission. This project demonstrates my ability to analyze, secure, and refactor software applications while following industry security standards. When showcasing my work to employers, I would highlight my implementation of HTTPS, SSL encryption, SHA-256 checksum verification, and vulnerability assessments, proving my skills in software security, encryption, and risk management.
